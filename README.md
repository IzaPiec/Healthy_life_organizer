# Healthy_life_organizer


The project is a healthy life organizer - a place where users can plan each aspect of healthy and active life. The web application will help people to plan their trainings, meals and control calories level. To plan an exercise or a meal, users can add their own or choose from a selection/catalogue of existing items. When selecting an exercise or a meal users will be informed on how many calories they will burn or gain.
